# Toaster :bread::bagel::waffle:

A toaster as a simple function.

Some improvements that could be made include (but are not limited to):

- refactor into a class (could inherit a `CountdownTimer` class)
- refactor timing functionality with `setTimeout()`
- implement cook(?) by heat behaviour
  - only turn on inner coils when `isBagel`
- include early cancel method
- include `defrostMode`
- include `sidewaysMode` method (:trollface:)
