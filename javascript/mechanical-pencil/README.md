# Mechanical Pencil :pencil2: (:sweat_smile:)

This implementation covers the basic functionality for a mechanical pencil.

Some improvements that could be made include (but are not limited to):

- include `disassembleWhenBored` method (:trollface:)
- include `retractOnPush` method
- include error handling when too much graphite gets dispensed
- include error handling when eraser gets used too much
- include method to replace eraser
- turn this into an interactive web app using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
