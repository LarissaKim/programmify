# Choose from a restaurant menu :plate_with_cutlery::thinking:

I turned (a simplified version of) my process of choosing what to order from a restaurant into code.

Some improvements that could be made include (but are not limited to):

- handle menus that are not in English (distinguish between languages I understand and those I don't)
- perform additional decision filtering
- could get real fancy with machine learning classification algorithms :sparkles:
