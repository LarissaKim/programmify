# Vending Machine :convenience_store:

An object-oriented (:smirk:) vending machine.

Some improvements that could be made include (but are not limited to):

- initialize with a starting balance to provide change
- include random chance of item getting stuck
- include `kickWhenStuck` method
- include `restockInventory` method
- include `withdrawBalance` method
- include `outOfService` mode
- use multi-dimensional array for inventory
