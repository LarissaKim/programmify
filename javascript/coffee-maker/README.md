# Single-Serve Coffee Maker :coffee:

I chose to boil down (:smirk:) the core functionality of a coffee maker to the process of combining water with the grinds in a coffee pod.

Some improvements that could be made include (but are not limited to):

- error handling for the inputs (e.g. reject incompatible `coffeePod` type, min/max check for `waterInMilli`)
  - `coffeePod` could be an object with additional metadata
- refactor into a class with `makeCoffee` as a method
  - could also include maintenance needs (e.g. descale method)
- turn this into an interactive web app that implements [HTCPCP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2324) (:trollface:)
