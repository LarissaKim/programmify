# Electric Fan :dash:

This implementation focuses on the button interface(?) found on an electric fan.

Some improvements that could be made include (but are not limited to):

- refactor into a class with `speed` and `isOn` as properties
- include method for oscillation
- include method for fan height adjustment
- include method for fan angle adjustment

Also came across this super cool video on YouTube: [How does an Oscillating Fan work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVnrD9m3nSI)
